# C++ Ballistics Calculator

This is a tool to display the motion characteristics of a projectile. The user feeds the program data such as launch velocity, angle, height, etc, and the program takes it from there.

As of now, the program is in a basic form and will output an arbitrary graph of projectile motion on a flat surface without air resistance. Many more features are to come.

Output Example:
